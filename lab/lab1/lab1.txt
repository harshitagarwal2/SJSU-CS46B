Step 8

Yes, I understand what plagiarism is and

Eclipse marks bad code at the left side of the source code,

Step 9

It's better to divide the sum of masses by applying .length
because the source code is not always accesible and it's a
good practice to write code that can be used regardless of
the size of the array. Also, dividing by 8 would be hard coding
the method, which is bad.


Step 10

The score reduced substantially.

Step 12

yes
